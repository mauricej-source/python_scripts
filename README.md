**Day to Day Python Scripts**

A series of Python Scripts used to analyze many things. Among them was Terraform and Helm and how it applies to IaC and CICD.  
Terraform can be a messy construct if not properly maintained and integrated.  
The Python Scripts are based upon Modularized Terraform to help the engineer better understand what resources are being generated within the Cloud.

As suggested earlier, there are other script that aid in clean-up, Operating System Validation, as well as an attempt to Atlassian and Bitbucket Repositories.
Did not quite finish those, only because Atlassian was due to sunset the Application Auth Token and move to the API Auth Token.
